1. [HackerRank](http://hr.gs/4befbb4c-9b6c-4656-96a9-9496b6948448)(password:
   `checkAout`)
2. [ActiveRecord Querying](./active_record_pt1/README.md)
3. [Building a Rails Project - BlogApp](./build_rails_project_pt2/BlogApp/README.md)

## Scoring and time estimates

| Component                | Maximum Points | Estimated Time (minutes) |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| HackerRank               | 54             | 30 min                   |
| ActiveRecord Querying    | 26             | 45 min                   |
| Building a Rails Project | 25             | 45 min                   |

A detailed breakdown of the point values within each component is available in
the instructions for the component. The maximum number of points for this entire
evaluation is **105**. Your final score will be calculated as the percentage of
points awarded over the maximum number of points:

`score = (total_points_awarded / 105) * 100`

The passing score for this evaluation is **75**.
