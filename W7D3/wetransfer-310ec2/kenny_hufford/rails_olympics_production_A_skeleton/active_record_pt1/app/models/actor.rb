# N+1 PORTION OF THE EVALUATION HERE:

# Below write a method named `title_and_director_of_movie`. This method will be 
# called on an Actor model instance and will return a return a HASH (not an ActiveRecord:Relation)
# with the title of the movies this actor has been in as the key and the value being 
# the director of that movie (which can be found via the director_id column on the movies table).

# Limit your results to the first three movies alphabetically.

# Naively solving this problem will inherently create an N+1 query. Full credit
# will only be given for methods that do NOT create an N+1 query.

# Scoring: 6 points maximum
#   3 points awarded for passing all five of the examples
#   3 additional points awarded if the implementation does not suffer from N+1


# This component of the evaluation is estimated to take 10 minutes.
